# Raw-Strings-C-Style
Note: I'm writing this mainly for myself as some kind of guidance.

C-Style strings were introduced with C programming language, and since C++ supports all features of C language this type can be used in C++ programming as well.
This C-style string is a one-dimensional array of characters that is terminated by a null character ‘\0’
